# SecondLifeUA on React🚀️

* The concept from the diploma project was taken as the basis of the  charity clothing exchange platform: [SecondLife_UA](https://github.com/OlegKhromow/SecondLife_UA)
* The backend is built using Express and mongoose to access mongoDB and the frontend is created using the React library.

---

*Due to lack of time, the project is a little unfinished and can be improved**
